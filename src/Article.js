      <p> React.js will provide a very flexible and modular framework for creating web applications moving forward. While the initial introduction is quite different from what we have learned so far, it is inherently more robust. Being able to compartmentalize different components and functions should make conceptualizing web applications more intuitive and provide a visual medium for our thought processes.</p>
      <p>I am looking forward to the opportunity to learn more about this unique framework, especially as to how it can be utilized in ways beyond web development for general app production for things such as iOS and Android. This is really exciting territory because I feel like this is an example of how things are really done in development jobs in the market today. Learning REACT will greatly improve the marketability of my resume for future employers</p>
